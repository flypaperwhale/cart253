Interrupt Skyglow is a short game in which the player must walk around the town
of Skyglow, receiving and exchanging Items with npcs, on a mission to get the lights
in the city turned out.
The player is playing as Dolly, a young person who after getting a glimpse of a
constellation in the introduction of the game, decides to try to do something about
the light pollution in her town.

What inspired this game for me was trying to find a simple enough game to succeed in
coding with arrays, creating these strange, intricate connections between different
elements of the game, in this case the player, the npcs, and the items. While the
storyline and the characters are a bit hair brained (though I hope charming in their
own kind of way) in a future game I would look to explore further, deeper ways to have
these elements interact and change each other.

The tale of turning out the lights does come from my concern with the way humans
disconnect from the natural environment, through industrialization, and today digitalization. We are distracted and we forget that we are a part of nature, and to understand ourselves, we might want to start by looking at where we come from and what we're made of. I'm particularly worried
about the Elon Musk's Starlink project, which seeks to send up tens of thousands of
"Low Earth Orbit" satellites, and these satellites contribute to on-going light pollution. I perceive it as a form of enclosure upon the global common that is the night sky.

Interrupt Skyglow is a fun, satirical, light way for me to deal with these existential
worries that I often think about. The creativity I was able to express in coding this Project
was not hindered by my own racing ideas as under time constraints and the excitement
of learning this new medium, pushed me to find the ways to express what I could, knowing
I could always come back later and build on what I have coded.
