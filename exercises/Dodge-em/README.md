# Dodge-em E2

In this simulation, the user is a white ball that must dodge the clowns and
displace the pink ball from the clowns.
If the user is touched by the clowns, they transform into a clown and must
not touch the ball.
If the ball is touched by the floating clowns or the user as a clown, a bad
surprise awaits the user.
