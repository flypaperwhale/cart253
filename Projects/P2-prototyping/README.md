# Interrupting Sky Glow

This is the README file for the entire project. For more official projects you should write information here about the nature of the project, your name, any special explanations of how the project works, etc.

This program is a videogame prototype.
It is a trading sequence game where the plot is that of a young girl exploring her little town meeting people in hopes of finding ways to turn off the street lamps and getting to perceive constellations in the sky. A surprise awaits her when she succeeds.

It is not possible to lose at this game, but it is possible to give up. The game does not save. But it is short.
