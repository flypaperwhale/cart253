# About this program

This program is a simulation of some of the visuals and audio effects for my P2.
I've added: a beginning cut scene of the day setting and the stars fading in.
These visuals are set with audio of the setting sun and the reveal of the shimmering stars.
Then the lamp flickers with cues on the flickering sound
and an electrical hum starts along with the sky glow.
a few seconds later the bgmusic starts playing.
when the player is closer to the lamppost the buzzing sound is louder.
with a mouseclick, the bulb explodes, the buzz ends, but the bgmusic keeps playing.
