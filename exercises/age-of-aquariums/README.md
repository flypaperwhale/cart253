In this program the user is visited by spirit orbs. With Hermes' staff the user can connect with these spirits. One particular spirit is the user's guide. If the user can discern and find them, or find them by chance, they will receive a secret message. If the user cannot find the secret spirit under 3 tries, the user is prompted to try again.
