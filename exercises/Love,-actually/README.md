# Love, actually (about plants and seeds)

This is a very basic simulation in which I am exploring the idea of two organisms
meeting and producing offspring. It is so basic that the offspring can only
be perceived as the consequent changing color of the background after the two
procreating ellipses meet. Green for plant offspring. Gray for desertion.
